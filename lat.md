# Welcome to LAT Group
LAT (Language Analysis and Translation) is a (virtual) group at NLP Center, Tencent AI Lab. The mission of LAT group is to make machines understand natural language and bridge the gaps between two different languages. 

## Research Fields

- Natural Language Analysis and Understanding: theories and algorithms for morphology, syntax and semantics.
- (Neural) Machine Translation: Models, Algorithms, Interpretability etc.
- Interactive Machine Translation: Interactive methods, models and evaluation metrics.
