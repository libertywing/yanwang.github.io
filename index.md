# Welcome to Yan Wang's Homepage

My name is 王琰 (Yan Wang). I am currently the NLP topic owner of miHoYo. Proir to that, I was a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab, working on Dialogue and Text Generation. I recieved my Ph.D. degree at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) in July 2017, under the instructions of Prof. Hanxiong Li. You can reach me through yanwang.branden(at)gmail.com

## Life & Hobbies
As the captain of the Tencent Technology and Engineering Group basketball team, I have won one championship and two runners-up in Tencent. Before that, I served as the captain of the CityU post-graduate basketball team and won seven championships in Hong Kong. Furthermore, I met my wife on the basketball team, who was the captain of the CityU female post-graduate basketball team.

I also served as the Chair of the Fitness Association of Tencent Technology and Engineering Group. 

About ten years ago, I dreamed to be a professional E-sports player (RTS game). Now I am still a top-1000 player in the world in Warcraft III Ladder.
