# Welcome to Yan Wang's Homepage

My name is 王琰 (Yan Wang). I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab, working on Dialogue and Text Generation. Before join Tencent, I recieved my Ph.D. degree at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) in July 2017, under the instructions of Prof. Hanxiong Li. You can reach me through ALIAS at Tencent dot com (ALIAS = brandenwang)

## Life & Hobbies
As the captain of the Tencent Technology and Engineering Group basketball team, I have won one championship and two runners-up in Tencent. Before that, I served as the captain of the CityU post-graduate basketball team and won seven championships in Hong Kong. Furthermore, I met my wife on the basketball team, who was the captain of the CityU female post-graduate basketball team.

I also served as the Chair of the Fitness Association of Tencent Technology and Engineering Group. 

About ten years ago, I dreamed to be a professional E-sports player (RTS game). Now I am still a top-1000 player in the world in Warcraft III Ladder.
