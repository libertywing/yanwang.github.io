# Welcome to Yan Wang's Homepage

My name is Yan Wang. I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab, working on Dialogue and Text Generation. Before join Tencent, I recieved my Ph.D. degree at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) in July 2017, under the instructions of Prof. Hanxiong Li. 

## More about me
As the captain of Tencent Technology and Engineering Group and Tencent AI Lab, I have won one championship and two runners-up in Tencent. Before that, I served as the captain of the CityU post-graduate basketball team and won seven championships in Hong Kong. Furthermore, I met my wife on the basketball team, she was the captain of the CityU female post-graduate basketball team.
